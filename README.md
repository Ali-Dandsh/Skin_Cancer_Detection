# ðŸ©º Skin Cancer Detection (CNN + Flask Web App)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **Deep Learning-based web application** designed to classify skin lesions (benign vs malignant) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained with TensorFlow/Keras.  
It consists of:
- **Model Training**: `skin_cancer_project.py` trains the CNN and saves the model (`skin2.h5`).
- **Web Interface**: `app.py` provides a Flask-based interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Upload images** for real-time classification.
- **Deep Learning CNN Model** trained on medical image datasets.
- **Flask Web App** for user interaction.
- **Visualization** of training/validation performance.
- **Confidence score** for predictions.
